# Mergesort

Implement an iterative (no recursive calls) and in-place version of mergesort.
Use the template I've provided in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've
provided some basic testing code that uses
[jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in `code.test.js`.

Hint: To make merge sort in-place, think about what happens during the merge --
where are elements moved to and from? To make it iterative, think about the
part of the array each recursive call considers.

## Runtime Analysis

Analyse the time complexity of your implementation and give a $\Theta$ bound for
its worst-case runtime. Add your answer, including your reasoning, to this
markdown file.

Recall my function:
```js
function mergesort(array) {
    var subarraysize = 1;
    while (subarraysize < array.length) {
        for (var start = 0; start < array.length; start += 2 * subarraysize) {
            var midsub = Math.min(start + subarraysize, array.length);
            var endsub = Math.min(start + 2 * subarraysize, array.length);
            var a = start, b = midsub;
            while (a < b && b < endsub) {
                if (array[a] <= array[b]) {
                    a++;
                } else {
                    let t = array[b];
                    for (let k = b; k > a; k--) {
                        array[k] = array[k - 1];
                    }
                    array[a] = t;
                    a++;
                    b++;
                }
            }
        }
        subarraysize *= 2;
    }
    return array;
}
```

1. The outer while loop runs $log_2 n$ times. This is becauseit begins at one a will keep doubling until doubling would result in being bigger than the array.
2. The outermost for loop runs once for every subarray. There are $\frac{n}{2 \text{ subarray size }$ subarrays at any given time.
3. The innermost while loop and the innermost for loop handle the merging. The in the worst case the while loop runs $n$ times and the for loop runs also run $n$ times when shifting the elements. Thus combined they result in $\Theta(n^2)$.


Hence, multiplying those, the time complexity is:

$$
T(n) \in \Theta(n^3 log n)
$$
